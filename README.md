# Minimal example showing keras integration to not log metrics

Setup:

1. Create a virtual environment (tested with Python 3.8)
2. `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Set NEPTUNE_API_TOKEN and NEPTUNE_PROJECT.
4. `python example.py`
5. Verify that metrics were not logged.

The example is taken verbatim from the documentation so it should work.
